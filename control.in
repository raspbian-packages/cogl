Description: Object oriented GL/GLES Abstraction/Utility Layer
 Cogl is a small open source library for using 3D graphics hardware to draw
 pretty pictures. The API departs from the flat state machine style of
 OpenGL and is designed to make it easy to write orthogonal components that
 can render without stepping on each others toes.

 This package should be used as a build-dependency by programs that use the
 cogl-path API, but is currently an empty package that depends on libcogl-dev
 due to circular dependencies between the base cogl API and the cogl-path API.
